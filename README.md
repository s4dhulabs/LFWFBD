### About this Project 
The first thing to be aware of here is: It is meant to be precisely what the name indicates: **Case studies** into how to look at the issues and possibly handle them in a less harmful fashion (and more creative one).

Equally crucial to heads up that this project is a product of brainstorming and creativity and doesn't aim to offer bullet guns, magical formulas, or universal truths about how to approach AppSec, mainly because there is no such thing. 

Instead, this is about ideas I've been brainstorming for a long time during my journey in information security. That said, this insight may also help you somehow, whether you're developing or testing application controls.
